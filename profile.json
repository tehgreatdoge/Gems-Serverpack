recipes, add new custom items, script world events, all in JavaScript!","body":"# KubeJS\n\n---\n\n## What does this mod do?\nThis mod lets you create scripts in JavaScript language to manage your server, add new blocks and items, change recipes and tags, add custom handlers for quest mods, change worldgen and more!\n\n## How to use it?\nRun the game with mod installed once. It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can report issues on [Here](https://kubejs.com/support?source=kubejs).\n\n## I have more questions/suggestions!\nIf wiki didn't have the answer for what you were looking for, you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/lat) and ask for help in one of the `#support`

Many mods utilize Bookshelf's code base to power their own mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Why use a library mod?</h3>\n<p>Library mods such as Bookshelf allow seemingly unrelated mods to share parts of the same code base. This reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features. The Library's code base is also tested in a wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead to less bugs and better performance in mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Features for Players</h3>\n<p>While this mod is primarily for mod authors, there are a few useful features for Players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands</a> like /bookshelf hand to get item IDs.</li>\n<li>Many new <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack features</a> like crafting recipes that damage items with durability rather than consuming them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Features for Modders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/blob/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/serialization/Serializers.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serialization for JSON/Network/NBT formats.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/util\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utility Functions.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/registry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registry manager, including non-forge registry types, debugging, and statistics.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#recipe-types\" rel=\"nofollow\">New recipe types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#ingredients\" rel=\"nofollow\">New ingredient types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#loot-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot condition types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#global-loot-modifiers\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot modifier types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#item-predicates\" rel=\"nofollow\">New item predicates.</a></li>\n<li>Check <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki</a> for more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs. However, developers can still provide their own GUIs for their mod-specific slots if they want.

They can move about the world, placing and breaking blocks, swinging a sword to protect you from zombies,\nor whatever else you program them to!\n\n![A turtle tunneling in Minecraft.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/turtle.png)\n\nNot all problems can be solved with a pickaxe though, and so CC: Tweaked also provides a bunch of additional peripherals\nfor your computers. You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your\ncomputers together with modems, and much more.\n\nComputers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item\nmanagement systems.\n\n![A chest's contents being read by a computer and displayed on a monitor.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/peripherals.png)\n\n## Getting Started\nWhile ComputerCraft is lovely for both experienced programmers and for people who have never coded before, it can be a\nlittle daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:\n\n - [Direwolf20's ComputerCraft tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUHUhfCY5A \"ComputerCraft Tutorial Episode 1 - HELP! and Hello World\")\n - [Sethbling's ComputerCraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSsx4VSe-Uk \"Programming Tutorial with Minecraft Turtles -- Ep. 1: Intro to Turtles and If-Then-Else_End\")\n - [Lyqyd's Computer Basics 1](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/15033-computer-basics-i/ \"Computer Basics I\")\n\nOnce you're a little more familiar with the mod, the [wiki](https://tweaked.cc/) provides more detailed documentation on the\nvarious APIs and peripherals provided by the mod.\n\nIf you get stuck, do [ask a question on GitHub][GitHub Discussions] or pop in to the ComputerCraft's [IRC channel][IRC].\n\n## Get Involved\nCC: Tweaked lives on [GitHub].

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2023-12-11T22:48:54.192826Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":339272,"followers":690,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX","8ZQqfeXy","3FEq2lT7","FeV5OquF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"4FXHDE9F","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":true,"name":"1.10.53 (Forge 1.20.1)","version_number":"1.10.53-forge","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.20.1 to Modrinth.

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2023-10-01T09:40:10.683782Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":524077,"followers":1223,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","b1.7.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"stb5nE30","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20–1.20.1 Forge] Mouse Tweaks 2.25","version_number":"1.20-2.25-forge","changelog":"- Updated to Minecraft 1.20.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-11T22:36:15.075064Z","downloads":54438,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"487206c6116aa742d3c9fe638f4388c0b82e2837e25552faec21d2abf960f95a46a0132b704bb46b78e559ab42e8512b50719311b37bd2c6b3c4764869eb1f07","sha1":"f3e8805d706a36717306d92bd5c45cb2aef854b6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/stb5nE30/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25.jar","primary":true,"size":76146,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"e2b99d4ce7cfc48b457ececbdf8f895980b3f071567b1940b048ca3a8eded1df86f713cdf7a3c2fe85ec2eec9c42a41bc2650a66fe63a099dcece3935a8c144a","sha1":"b11c08657d0daa8de55ed950bb10f320113fa017"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/stb5nE30/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25-api.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25-api.jar","primary":false,"size":1995,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"6cf2985e3f034ce0472f6ab2ac4877e4c248a53a","sha512":"a6dbe724e2f159e05a9b1e4b7a55081d884b4dfc4054bfe3ff70dcd8787b60eda717282913255d00bbb7e0855f436b8656ccd69f600aa8b7787e1ea1d4ce7fe1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/stb5nE30/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25-src.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25-src.jar","primary":false,"size":19690,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25.jar"},"mods\\JustEnoughResources-1.20.1-1.4.0.238.jar":{"sha512":"f947eee21dd7d77589879eebd8be69c6914e06d2dc04715ee666d85c9c52337fc66f593e935e495780b9ae101bbadc25cc55d6ef89932a293417cad81dbbf0a9","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Just Enough Resources","description":"Adds Resources and Mob Drops to JEI\n","authors":["way2muchnoise"],"version":"1.4.0.238","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"JustEnoughResources-1.20.1-1.4.0.238.jar"},"mods\\endertanks-forge-1.20.1-1.2.jar":{"sha512":"c6ab658d56e5ed628ffe90f1445aeb82170ae8dfe543c76070c1bd7b4594843b98014a343a926781c22a422e33afd4b6a39c4074f77c03b49816dc7bba0ba013","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"zZwEA08D","slug":"endertanks","project_type":"mod","team":"alUGFigO","title":"EnderTanks","description":"Adds linked Tanks and Buckets that share inventory.\n\nCan be Public, Personal, or Team, each with their own set of storage available.\n\nWorks across dimensions.","body":"![](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/zZwEA08D/images/4612f68b0fed38ff885f584bc88bb7d5e9e180e8.png)\n*** [ShetiPhianCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/shetiphiancore) Required! ***\n\n## This mod adds Dimensional Item Storage.\n\n![](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/zZwEA08D/images/95258735707333a965ced6f37ca146a503ed2e67.png)\n\n#### EnderTank\n- Dimensional liquid tank.

[Applied Energistics 2][ae2] providing higher tiers of storage, ranging in capacity from 1M to as high as 256M, similarly to add-ons of old such as Extra Cells 2 and its successors.\n\nUnlike conventional add-ons in the same vein, MEGA does things quite differently, featuring its own dedicated progression line and components to further augment and challenge existing AE2 players' set-ups, while emphasising a distinct visual style with jet-black colour schemes.\n\n## ![Features][header_features]\n- **1M - 256M** item and fluid cells (standard + portable)\n- MEGA **Crafting CPUs** with bespoke all-black crafting units: 1M - 256M storage, 4-threaded co-processing unit and matching monitor\n- Integration with multiple other AE2 add-ons such as [Applied Mekanistics][appmek] (1-256M chemical cells) and [Applied Botanics][appbot] (1-256M mana cells)\n- **MEGA Bulk Item Storage Cell**: Designed for infinite storage of a single item type\n- **Bulk Compression**: Automatic conversion between ingots, nuggets and blocks for bulk item cell storage, with full support for auto-crafting via the **Decompression Module**\n- **MEGA Pattern Provider**: Double-capacity storage for processing patterns\n- **Superdense Energy Cell** and **Greater Energy Card**: Increased energy storage for AE networks and portable devices\n\n...and more still to come.\n\n## ![License][header_license]\nAll

Join the [AE2 discord server](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne) for discussion.\n\nThis is a Forge mod for 1.18.2 which requires both AE2 and Mekanism.\n\n## Chemical support\nApplied Mekanistics adds chemical support to existing AE2 devices. For example, this means that you can put an import bus on a chemical tank, export bus on a chemical tank, storage bus on a radioactive waste barrel, attach pressurized tubes to interfaces or use chemicals in crafting recipes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hTShq45.png)\n\n## Chemical cells\nApplied Mekanistics also adds 1k, 4k, 16k and 64k chemical storage cells. You can now store gasses in your ME Drives! Do however note that they don't support radioactive gasses!\n\n## Chemical P2P tunnels\nApplied Mekanistics adds Chemical P2P Tunnels for high-throughput chemical transfer. Simply right click any Mekanism chemical tank on a P2P tunnel to convert it.\n\n## QIO support for Storage Bus\nApplied Mekanistics also allows the Storage Bus to interact with the contents of a QIO frequency. Just place the storage bus on the side of a QIO Dashboard.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EMxQdXR.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sif07Mx.png)\n\n## Recipes\n\nTo create a chemical housing, you'll need to use Osmium ingots instead of Iron or Copper ingots\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wXzGjtU.png)\n\nThe housing can be combined with a cell component to craft a storage cell\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7J3EU7l.png)","published":"2022-06-25T21:48:12.557632Z","updated":"2023-11-05T11:43:47.367261Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":12044,"followers":30,"categories":["storage","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["sGOs3fJx","b9XlfAwn","iYZmHmKf","zPUceDl0","7agSGPsS","EX7BxaHP","1mwC2ZzC","r0mdRXIa","TbjiRSjd","d9GM663Q"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/IiATswDj/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"d9GM663Q","project_id":"IiATswDj","author_id":"z0r5biKh","featured":false,"name":"1.4.2","version_number":"1.4.2","changelog":"View changelog at [the release page](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Mekanistics/releases/tag/1.4.2)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-05T11:43:48.374553Z","downloads":4364,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"1c6742e3ac2662844c720a42728a10bb9648d13b","sha512":"ea5ce898888da123405a676fe1dc0a6a15e0eb5cfa1cc8bcda50de50e559ff92434c391e88c6bf5bc8c46e864518ae4ebdade8da47fe1f48b5c77135d0f6052e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/IiATswDj/versions/d9GM663Q/Applied-Mekanistics-1.4.2.jar","filename":"Applied-Mekanistics-1.4.2.jar","primary":true,"size":178447,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ce6I4WUE","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"XxWD5pD3","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"RNvAjQYw","user":{"id":"z0r5biKh","username":"ramidzkh","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19631324?v=4","bio":"I write dumb mods","created":"2020-10-27T20:06:42.423613Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Applied-Mekanistics-1.4.2.jar"},"mods\\HammerLib-1.20.1-20.1.24.jar":{"sha512":"d1d0dc3020d1085305ad332a907e1136ba513804808757b6252adb92a719aeceb17ab30dc826c74d4190ff415fe749e61e496c268c90ccfc119b5c8c10465d3e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"PlkSuVtM","slug":"hammer-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"YMdyWcBI","title":"HammerLib","description":"Utility mod that contains really useful code for quite a few mods.","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://assets.zeith.org/logos/hammer-lib.png?v=2\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"130\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_247401_downloads.svg\" width=\"165\" height=\"10\" /><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/247401_all.svg\" width=\"373\" height=\"18\" /></p>\n<p>Utility mod that contains really useful code for quite a few mods.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>This library provides:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple, <a href=\"https://github.com/dragon-forge/ImprovableSkills/blob/1.19.2/src/main/java/org/zeith/improvableskills/init/SkillsIS.java\">annotation-based</a> content registration.\n<ul>\n<li>For Blocks, HammerLib automagically registers BlockItem(s).

This will start the growth process for your crop. The crop may take a while to grow, you can speed it up by right clicking with bone meal and other fertilizers. Once the crop is done growing right click it to harvest and automatically plant another. To remove items from the botany pot you can sneak and right click the block with an empty hand. Breaking the block will also work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>While this mod may seem simple on it's surface, there are many technical details involved.

It presents a tech-based, futuristic theme, centered around the concept of using energy and technology to convert matter into energy and vice versa. Please come visit our [homepage](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne).\n\n![image of subnetworks from the guidebook](https://guide-assets.appliedenergistics.org/minecraft-1.20.1/ae2/ae2-mechanics/subnetworks_scene1.njRxulYCJ84v.png)\n\nKey features of the mod include:\n\n**Storage Systems**: AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers. Many of these new materials come with their own decorative blocks to spice up your builds.\n\nAE2 is known for the complexity and depth it adds to Minecraft's tech gameplay, encouraging players to create, optimize, and manage large-scale, efficient systems. It is a fantastic mod for those who love to automate processes and manage resources efficiently.","published":"2021-12-14T11:50:43.324146Z","updated":"2023-12-31T21:59:45.912780Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":193145,"followers":427,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["OqkivEmV","DZZbZnbH","cLm6eoS7","Bf4qfsQf","6AN4WLgf","n6ctl28A","ePPHPjw7","EkIUZgzp","uWZo3axN","kOb7LSAK","pRtKJO4l","2TIYWbvo","aUAC5DXB","mlkfFOT9","Q6LSGEqw","f0cVzJbq","xKkeaqkM","2OY506tW","LmtoNQhm","Ieppgyii","XSv7aCzj","7rSpITeE","Z32dIodF","fMM2pwnM","Woty8glY","NFcpTG3k","W5IItIBw","xDGpy4Qn","ByV6cOMZ","nZG3f7mn","697yLiPU","fjroW9SS","BF8g0TZ3","sWmGENVC","qosXJAjq","OiY2lfg0","3FuIT2JI","5KhL4WhW","RWto5Lhw","wHN8x90L","sm5CvPw0","oMLKu1Ze","nuYdiTZB","oLeqpmhw","mV6fTxoi","kOcIph1U","HJrR1zgA","JSwFZQ02","aR5tGCcS","s3g4KtWI","enxs5scj","9WXP1AHX","mv6YbdV3","7Gq3qbtw","bD9ZXRfC","7UmbOb4g","WVYkyvRH","bpkm2yMw","C5nwXELu","ZaNpnMCh","OFBWYrp4","PvPdRUHX","PDkmB4UV","zkC0WSUn","Z6jnGDF9","5xa1OSzf","5EyIPVWA","XVFb5sJ7","WzDBx3u7","YNFx3Hjn","nrq8eC4Q","6VmOchNB","9XtLETKp","hCIvVRgg","RFmdcgz3","vrdekdmw","Z8OKgUoh","P4SHVMac","25KjhlGv","S3K8G49B","6qQEQmM8","36EMfB3q","DZd4yQe4","c3zEVaQ8","wYymrhE4","8HeKobcP","yz68xU3j","pcHc3tZs","MrXpPIvo","aszqg0Wn","WAh5HPC8","RgkwNSjT","62yssi1E","A5FUIGjh","q5TQ3zgd","9P35YnKN","ix3GcoBP","RJnK9Ovj","MoGLgJK1","t3aUE6HS","7NWAte1m","PWdOzVug","HQd68kb6","lp2vAcHP","c0KKkf1Z","zhr2jXaL","9evKVcVd","MPdVG6oo","COSdQAoF","TBVf9h2p","CKA0xF7f","GL3uhBGD","brl6VeNy","TMEAMYIx","g7uJnOOS","sALiGsl3","yIupDKor","oAGWsu3M","JRLfd73N","UAuf0uiD","3Mvq6QHo","L6VGYHd3","y5W8KGqT","xGjt6qMm","sOqmy2ww","COba8tGt","8C4WbuoI","NX3fAZif","DsTIvcA1","Tw8kyhfI","NHcKcc8c","Xc1WEGPd","1HKx8M9v","qf2Yz73T","8HEK7sk8","ijZQY1Rd","xzP4cydc","a5pC6xdL","QalOLGBM","RpMpf7zi","Zrp3c9yN","7vB6vk2v","7ACUdipn","Sz6f1zJd","qfpQmwll","lePuKDdy","TKhjxSIB","oS3Ga2mY","7j0MvcB1","IcREcVDb","Mdn0ka1O","AxEi5RIz","b13bPfeM","rLjoLUTF","wGIGpPsQ","tifFqBKk","W4efZESl","lThI0ayT","qBbqV301","l3tOwBzj","LxjXwNSj","Bj8oQseU","IWm9cQdw","CkK2zzkf","xUoHYNEg","5cb16tgY","HAKkYcmv","1kT0YXJf","BUHQD4RJ","lT1sdBmI","fwLnPXom","8edEAu2V","aQH6ftSR","U3MExcIx","OIOSSXhK","Cf5vGMwV","XfVOZDN8","jgICE67P","nhQTb3m4","ZVjAvWE5","MNGBfmiy","b1U0ez1e","fFh1IdTY"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XxWD5pD3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"U3MExcIx","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","author_id":"3HAu37Rl","featured":false,"name":"AE2

to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury

Mekanism is an *experience* that will forever change the way you play Minecraft.\n\nHere at Mekanism, Inc., we bring you a suite of low, mid, and high tier machinery to elevate your archaic home and inefficient resource processing to the 21st century. With our collection of high-tech tools, high-end energy generators, advanced transmission systems and intricate processing mechanisms, you’ll find yourself relieved of the tedious tasks of ‘mining’ and ‘crafting’ and quickly progressing to new levels of technological enlightenment.\n\nYou may not realize it, but every time you smelt an ore directly into its respective ingot, you’re wasting the majority of what you’ve mined. Mekanism’s team of experienced chemical and mechanical engineers have developed advanced ore processing machinery to extract resources from ores with utmost efficiency. With our purification, dissolution, chemical injection, and crystallization technologies, you can now double, triple, quadruple, even *quintuple* your ingot production per ore, given enough infrastructure and energy.\n\nOur engineering team understands and embraces gradual technological progression. For whatever stage of gameplay you’ve reached, we offer a tier of machinery to suit your needs. Every Mekanism machine can be upgraded to a factory, allowing you to process, 3 (basic), 5 (advanced), 7 (elite), or even 9 (ultimate) different items at once -- in a single machine! No more are the rows, even *walls* of slow and ugly furnaces that once plagued your home. Condense your machinery infrastructure with Mekanism today.\n\nJust a few of the many reasons Mekanism will be the highlight of your Minecraft experience:\n- Hydrogen-powered **Jetpacks**, with multiple togglable flight modes\n- A small, cute, and loyal robotic friend (**Robit**!) to follow you around\n- A **Digital Miner** with state-of-the-art filtering technologies to automate your mining needs\n- A **Fusion Reactor** which uses advanced [internal confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion) technology to harness the power of the sun to run advanced machinery (*requires Mekanism Generators*)\n- Various transmitters for transferring items, fluids, gases, energy, and even heat!\n- An effective machinery configuration system, which allows for the creation of advanced item transport networks capable of sorting and filtering (using our patented **Logistical Transporters**!)\n\nLinks to other Mekanism modules:\n- [Mekanism Additions](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-additions)\n- [Mekanism Generators](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-generators)\n- [Mekanism Tools](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-tools)\n\n<br>\n\nWe **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** playing Mekanism with CyanideX's Unity: Dark Edition resource pack.\n- [Unity: Dark Edition](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unity-dark-edition/)\n- [Classic Unity](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unity/)","published":"2022-05-27T00:12:09.740488Z","updated":"2023-11-14T13:14:30.062285Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":86778,"followers":214,"categories":["equipment","storage","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.7.10"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["gqJMEABX","wukmoSeF","4QWCUteA","ruRBKgwc","KIzASRO5","dZZ4j18G","4IEoyWzh","IDjtJsDR","ZrS7qENE","nDxFueG2","DlhxRTKL","atcAq1UT","Pz4thLN2","ppz3xziS","g74zfl0m","RGlXXgcD","zWt8Aemn","zLHaraw3","yDOSRo2r","6zqf3EGe","OFopgIFW","xKRR7R7a","RBifwW3R","TAyUJAKw","X58zIngK","CgFgCgTf","yj7d33HE","MLG4wWo6","W5PUUWt9","GxZSvUQi","5fXP0XBe","52nOMLHi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Ce6I4WUE/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"52nOMLHi","project_id":"Ce6I4WUE","author_id":"81DWsUKb","featured":false,"name":"10.4.5.19","version_number":"10.4.5.19","changelog":"<a href=\"https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/e01e5df2d34cff97b2d56d3ebe73378e77432268\">e01e5df</a> -
